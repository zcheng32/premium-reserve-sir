# Premium and Reserve Estimation under SIR Epidemic Model

This project analyzes epidemic-linked insurance products by SIR model. We calculte premiums and reserves under infection and mortality benefits, and evaluate sensitivity to key epidemic parameters.

## Structure
- Simulate SIR dynamics
- Estimate infection and death probabilities
- Calculate pure premium under two methods
- Analyze sensitivity and reserve projection

## Tool
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
